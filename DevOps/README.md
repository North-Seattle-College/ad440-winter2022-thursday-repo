What you need to do for issue/tasks:


Task Management (10 pts)
Each student is responsible for managing her/his own task. Tasks for each team will be identified in class and written on the board but each team is responsible to assign the tasks between themselves and create them in GitHub. The following criteria for task management must be fulfilled for full points:
·       Task must be created and appear on the project board
·       Task must be tagged with the proper labels (team and bug/task)
·       Task must be tagged with the proper milestone
·       Task must be assigned to the responsible developer
·       Task must be in In Progress state while in development
·       Task must be in Done state at the end of the sprint
Note: If a task is not in Done state at the end of the sprint, it will automatically be graded with 0 points (also for the other areas). If a student misses two tasks, she/he automatically fails the class.
 
Implementation Quality (10 pts)
The goal of the practicum is to implement certain functionality. Each task will require written application, automation or security code. The grading criteria for this area are the following:
·       The code must be available in the development branch of the repository (see the Pull Request area below)
·       If the code requires cloud workloads it must be accessible using cloud endpoint (URL)
·       The code must be functioning for at least the core scenario (see the Documentation area below)
Documentation (10 pts)
Each developer must document how to test/execute the functionality they have implemented. The documentation must provide step-by-step instructions that include but is not limited to the following:
·       What part of the code implements the functionality? What to pull?
·       How to deploy the functionality locally or in the cloud?
·       How to configure the functionality?
·       How to access the implemented functionality?
·       What input to provide?
·       What output is expected?
·       Known troubleshooting steps
The purpose of the documentation is for a person who is completely unaware about the implementation to be able to test the functionality. 
Note: All the documentation must be added as a comment to the task.
Pull Request Quality (10 pts)
Each developer will implement the functionality in a fork of the GitHub repository. To integrate their changes, they must submit a Pull Request from their own fork to the project repository. The grading criteria for this area are as following:
·       Link to the Pull Request must be added to the task (comment is OK)
·       The Pull Request must be merged in the development branch without conflicts. Note: The Pull Request must use the development branch to compare. Pull Requests using the main branch will be automatically graded with 0 points.
Activities Documentation (10 pts)
Each task must include a comment describing the activities and the time required for each developer to complete their task. Rounding to the half of an hour is sufficient. Typical activities for development tasks include but are not limited to research, prototyping, implementation, deployment, testing, design/other discussion, task management etc. The following table should be present in the comment:
Date	Activity	Time Spent
 	 	 
 	 	 
 
Note: For each assignment to be graded, you must submit a link to your task in Canvas.
