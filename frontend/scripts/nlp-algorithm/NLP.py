Although our society generally believes that stress is bad, Kaufer\u2019s research has shown that a mild and brief experience of stress can have great advantages including improved alertness, performance and memory. Kaufer\u2019s research on rats demonstrates this, and she believes the results are the same for people. However, individuals vary on how much stress is harmful for them based on their resilience, confidence, control of the situation and early life exerpeinces. Furthermore, stress can also affect your physical health: increasing heart disease, suppressing the immune system, decreasing fertility and causing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In conclusion, Kaufer says that there are strategies to reduce stress, such as a positive attitude, a social support network and physical exercise, so even if we can\u2019t prevent things that stress us, we can at least try to help it benefit us.", "#6 is the quiz correct -- correct setup, but wrong signs for p and q -1 9/10", "#5  try again    -10", "#2-5 incorrect", "#2: How did you get -896?", "#2: In a condensed structural diagram, the benzene ring would be drawn as opposed to writing C6H5", "#21 missing hole in graph, asymptotes are not drawn on graph and table is missing.
